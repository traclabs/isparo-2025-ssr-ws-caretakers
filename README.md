To support future uncrewed space habitats, caretaker robots will need to perform maintenance by following procedures similar to those used by human crews. This work details the integration of the PRIDE electronic procedure platform with skill representations called Affordance Templates (ATs) by treating ATs as procedural subroutines. We introduce a single, generic System Representation (SysRep) to encapsulate all AT commands and telemetry, along with new automation (PAX) plugins to bridge the Java-based PRIDE system with the ROS 2-based AT framework. This integrated system is demonstrated in a simulated Intra-Vehicular Activity (IVA) environment based on the NASA iMETRO facility, where a UR10 robot arm successfully follows a human-readable PRIDE procedure to autonomously complete a multi-step Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) filter replacement task, validating this approach for integrating robotics into standard mission operations. A second demonstration is conducted using an Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) robot performing an inspection task with the same SysRep, validating the general applicability of the approach.
