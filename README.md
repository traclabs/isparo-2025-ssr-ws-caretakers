The Affordance Template task primitive framework has been garnering increased interest from researchers in the field as a conceptual format to define robot manipulation tasks within a supervised/shared autonomy paradigm. Affordance Templates provide graphical utilities to facilitate human-in-the-loop operation and can also support robot autonomy. This paper presents several extensions to the Affordance Template framework that (1) expand the types of behaviors that can be encoded beyond manipulation to include inspection and navigation, (2) facilitate their use in multi-agent tasks, and (3) outline how roles encoded in Affordance Templates can be dynamically assigned at run-time to match the capabilities of deployed systems. We formally introduce these extensions and provide example demonstrations that leverage these new definitions.
